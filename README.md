## Development

This theme is still in early stage of development!

Elements that need to be checked have a bright pink color: #FA00AF. I did not
manage to make them visible during the tests. Some of these elements may be
obsolete.

### To do

- [ ] Check the unknown elements
- [ ] Define colors for:
  - [ ] chat.*
  - [ ] inlineChat.*
  - [ ] interactive.*
- [ ] Test and improve syntax highlighting
